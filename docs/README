# eBitom (Governance & Reputation)

## Overview  
eBitom is a **soul-bound governance token**, meaning it cannot be transferred or sold. It serves as **proof of reputation and stake in the ecosystem**.  

## How It Works  
- Earned by **contributions** (coding, providing services, governance).  
- Tied to **Pd4d Protocol**, which ranks users based on participation.  
- Grants **governance rights** (voting, proposals, rewards).  

## Key Development Areas  
- **Reputation staking contracts**  
- **Voting mechanisms** for governance  
- **Integration into mApp**
