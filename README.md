# eBit (Stable Token)

## Overview  
eBit is a **stable digital currency** pegged to the USD through:  
1. **Cost-based stability** → Prices of goods/services paid in USD.  
2. **Mint/Burn schedules** → Controlling eBit supply relative to demand.  
3. **Real estate backing** → Stability tied to **eReal** (tokenized real estate).

## Key Development Areas  
- **Smart contracts**: Implement eBit’s mint/burn mechanics.  
- **Exchange mechanism**: Ensure seamless conversion between eBit and eBitom/eReal.
